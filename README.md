# Project03-JuicyBreakout


An upbeat, brick-breaking game in a beach setting.

## Implementation
Building off of the exercises, I added sound effects for the brick breaks, paddle collisions, and death. There are a total of three levels, each with a unique background and music. In addition, there is also a start menu, end menu, and death menu, which also have unique backgrounds and music.

## References
Sounds effects were create by Cas Wilson using ChipTone. Backgrounds were made by Lynocs on itch.io. Music was made by DavidKBD on itch.io.

## Future Development
